# Shell Scripting Journey

**Welcome to this repository!**

This repository is a collection of shell scripts designed as a learning resource for my shell scripting journey. Each script represents a different level of complexity and covers various aspects of shell scripting.


**Structure:** 

The repository is organized into directories, each focusing on a particular topic or difficulty level. Within each directory, you'll find two files:

* **Notes.md:** This file provides explanations, comments, and helpful information about the script's functionality.
* **Script.sh:** This is the actual shell script that demonstrates the concepts described in the notes.md file.


**Contributing:**

Feel free to contribute to this repository by adding new scripts, improving existing ones, or providing feedback. Your contributions are highly appreciated!

**Disclaimer:**

The scripts in this repository are provided as-is without any warranty. Use them at your own risk.

**Let's start scripting!**
