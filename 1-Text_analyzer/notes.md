## Project-1 Text Analyzer

Create a shell script that analyzes a text file and provides statistics about its content.


**Basic Functionality:** 


* Read text file: The script should take a text file as input.
* Line count: Count the total number of lines in the file.
* Word count: Count the total number of words in the file.
* Character count: Count the total number of characters in the file.
* Most frequent word: Identify the word that appears most frequently in the file.


**Additional Features (Optional):**
* Character frequency: Calculate the frequency of each character in the file.
* Word length analysis: Calculate the average word length, longest and shortest word.
* Stop word removal: Exclude common words (stop words) from the analysis.
* Output formatting: Present the results in a clear and organized format.
* Multiple file handling: Allow the script to process multiple files at once.


**Learning Outcomes:**
* Basic shell scripting syntax (functions, conditionals, loops).
* Text processing using command-line tools (wc, grep, sort, uniq).
* Data manipulation and analysis.
* Output formatting.

**Challenges and Considerations:**
* Handling different text formats (e.g., plain text, HTML).
* Efficiently processing large text files.
* Implementing advanced text analysis techniques.
